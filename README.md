# bitews

Simple proxy between a WebSocket and a TCP server. I made it to make [Bite](https://github.com/alvivar/bite) compatible with the web.

Run the server with **cargo run --release**. You will need a [Bite](https://github.com/alvivar/bite) server running for it to work.

You can use **client.html** to test the WebSocket part locally.

## Docker

    Soon...
