# bitews

_Deprecated_, [BITE](https://github.com/alvivar/bite) has changed a lot and this
prototype no longer works for his current protocol.

WebSocket proxy for [Bite](https://github.com/alvivar/bite).

Run the server with **cargo run --release**. You will need a
[Bite](https://github.com/alvivar/bite) server running for it to work.

You can use **client.html** to test it locally.
